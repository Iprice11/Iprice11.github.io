  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am Isaiah Price a multi-media artist an aspiring filmmaker, currently going to SJSU originally from Inglewood Ca. What inspires my work the most would be my childhood, growing up in the inner city i was immersed in hip-hop culture, and i believe through art i can help portray the aspects of the culture that i support. My work is not limited to hip-hop, i have a range of interest including scary movies, sports, politics etc, and through a lens i am granted creative freedom to cover any topic i please.

Currently i shoot music videos for local rappers, i also shoot both narrative and non narrative videos that critique certain stereotypes placed on individuals within hip-hop culture.
I explored mixing music in audio file to show my admiration for how some of the most iconic songs were constructed. My portfolio is still in progress but stay tuned for more work.
