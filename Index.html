      <h3>The Glorification Of the Trap, 2018</h3>
      <p>The Glorification Of the Trap is projected on the floor to expand on the concept that people outside of hip-hop culture look down on the image of a thug/drug dealer. The video itself is a projection of a few glorified actions that many rappers and other members of hip-hop culture glorify, The Hustle./p>
